# Meta App Review Response - pages_read_engagement Permission Clarification

## Response to Reviewer Requirements

Dear Meta Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the `pages_read_engagement` permission. We have thoroughly reviewed our application and identified that this permission was **incorrectly included in our submission**. Our application does **NOT** require or use the `pages_read_engagement` permission.

**Application Status:** Permission Scope Correction Required
**Issue:** Incorrect permission requested in app settings
**Solution:** Remove `pages_read_engagement` from permission requests

## Permission Clarification

### ❌ pages_read_engagement Permission - NOT NEEDED

We **DO NOT** require the `pages_read_engagement` permission for our application functionality. This permission was incorrectly included in our Facebook App configuration and should be **REMOVED** from our permission requests.

**Why We Don't Need This Permission:**
- Our application focuses exclusively on **advertising performance analysis**
- We do not read page posts, photos, videos, or events
- We do not access fan data or page metadata
- We do not require any page management functionality
- Our application is designed for **advertising account analysis only**

### ✅ Required Permissions - Actually Used in Application

Our application **ONLY** requires these two permissions, which are actively used:

#### 1. ads_read Permission
**Purpose:** Read advertising data for performance analysis
**Specific Usage in Application:**
- Read advertising account lists (`/me/adaccounts`)
- Retrieve campaign performance data (`/act_{account_id}/insights`)
- Analyze click-through rates and conversion rates
- Calculate ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
- Generate advertising performance reports

**Implementation Location:** 
- File: `server/metaAccountService.ts`
- API Endpoints: `/api/diagnosis/facebook-*`
- Frontend: Facebook Ad Health Check functionality

#### 2. ads_management Permission  
**Purpose:** Access detailed advertising account information
**Specific Usage in Application:**
- Retrieve detailed advertising account information
- Read ad groups and creative materials for analysis
- Analyze advertising placement settings
- Access comprehensive campaign metrics

**Implementation Location:**
- File: `server/diagnosisRoutes.ts` 
- OAuth Scope: `scope=ads_read,ads_management` (Line 66)
- Facebook API calls in metaAccountService

## Technical Implementation Verification

### Current OAuth Configuration
```javascript
// File: server/diagnosisRoutes.ts (Line 63-69)
const authUrl = `https://www.facebook.com/v19.0/dialog/oauth?` +
  `client_id=${appId}&` +
  `redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirectUri)}&` +
  `scope=ads_read,ads_management&` +  // ONLY these permissions
  `response_type=code&` +
  `state=${userId}&` +
  `auth_type=rerequest`;
```
