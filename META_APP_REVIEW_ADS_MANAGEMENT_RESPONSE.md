## ads_management Permission Usage Explanation

### Core Application Purpose
Our application is a **Facebook Advertising Health Check System** that provides AI-powered performance analysis and optimization recommendations for advertisers. We help business owners and marketing professionals optimize their Facebook advertising campaigns through data-driven insights.

### How We Use ads_management Permission

#### 1. Reading and Managing Ad Account Access
**Specific Usage:**
- **Read advertising accounts** that users have authorized (`/me/adaccounts`)
- **Access detailed account information** including account status, currency, timezone
- **Retrieve account-level permissions** to ensure proper data access
- **Read account spending limits** and budget constraints

**Implementation Location:**
- File: `server/metaAccountService.ts` (lines 50-80)
- API Endpoint: `/api/diagnosis/facebook-callback`
- Function: `getAdAccounts()`, `getAccountDetails()`

#### 2. Extracting Ad Performance Metrics
**Specific Usage:**
- **Read campaign insights data** (`/act_{account_id}/insights`)
- **Analyze ad set performance** including CTR, CPC, CPM metrics
- **Retrieve conversion data** and ROAS calculations
- **Access audience engagement metrics** for optimization recommendations

**Implementation Location:**
- File: `server/metaAccountService.ts` (lines 120-200)
- Functions: `getAccountInsights()`, `analyzeCampaignPerformance()`

#### 3. Advanced Campaign Analysis
**Specific Usage:**
- **Read ad creative performance** to identify top-performing content
- **Access placement data** (Facebook, Instagram, Audience Network)
- **Analyze demographic breakdowns** for audience optimization
- **Retrieve time-based performance data** for trend analysis

**Why ads_read Alone Is Insufficient:**
The `ads_read` permission only provides basic advertising data access. Our application requires `ads_management` to:
